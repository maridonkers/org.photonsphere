An integrated suite of [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) libraries backed by [Undertow](http://undertow.io/) for web, [HornetQ](http://jboss.org/hornetq/) for messaging, [Infinispan](http://infinispan.org/) for caching, [Quartz](http://quartz-scheduler.org/) for scheduling, and [Narayana](http://www.jboss.org/narayana) for transactions.

Applications built with Immutant can optionally be deployed to a [WildFly](http://wildfly.org/) or [JBoss EAP](http://www.jboss.org/products/eap/overview/) cluster for enhanced features. Its fundamental goal is to reduce the inherent [incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity) in real world applications. – [Immutant](http://immutant.org/) (by [project:odd](http://projectodd.org/) team).

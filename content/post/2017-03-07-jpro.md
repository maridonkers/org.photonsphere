JavaFX in the Browser - NO PLUGINS - EVERYWHERE – [JPRO](https://www.jpro.io/) (by **jpro technologies AG**).
<!--more-->

# From its documentation

jpro is a new technology which brings Java back into the browser - without Java Plugin. To achieve that, jpro runs [JavaFX](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/) on the server and maps its scenegraph directly into the browser. The client side rendering is highly optimized with browser side approximations to get a smooth user experience free of lags.

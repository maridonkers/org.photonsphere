Because I have been wanting to use [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) instead of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) for this site, I started using the [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) static site generator and converted all my content to org-mode. The [Thomas Read's blog](https://blog.thjread.com/#about/) (that I used as a template) even has [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) support implemented. Support for LaTeX is also possible with [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), I read online.

# org-mode

I had to add teaser support for [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) because the `<!--more-->` that is used for Markdown is escaped by [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) in conversion from [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) to [HMTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML). See [site.hs](https://github.com/maridonkers/org.photonsphere/blob/master/site.hs) on GitHub.

So `teaserFieldWithSeparator` is used instead of `teaserField`.

``` haskell
teaserFieldWithSeparator "(.MORE.)" "teaser" "content"
```

*Note: The teaser separator is actually lowercase but that gets replaced…*

And I've added a function `replaceTeaserSeparator` to replace the teaser separator with the regular HTML-comment version in the output.

``` haskell
import qualified Data.Text as T

...

>>= replaceTeaserSeparator "(.MORE.)" "<!--more-->"

...

-- | Replace teaser separator in item.
replaceTeaserSeparator :: String
                       -> String
                       -> Item String
                       -> Compiler (Item String)
replaceTeaserSeparator tsFrom tsTo item = do
    return $ fmap (replaceTeaserSeparatorWith tsFrom tsTo) item

-- | Teaser separator in HTML
replaceTeaserSeparatorWith :: String  -- ^ teaser separator to replace
                           -> String  -- ^ replacement teaser separator
                           -> String  -- ^ HTML to replace in
                           -> String  -- ^ Resulting HTML
replaceTeaserSeparatorWith tsFrom tsTo html =
    T.unpack $ T.replace tsFrom' tsTo' html'
    where tsFrom' = T.pack tsFrom
          tsTo' = T.pack tsTo
          html' = T.pack html
```

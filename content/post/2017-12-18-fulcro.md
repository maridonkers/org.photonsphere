A library for development of single-page full-stack web applications in [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) / [ClojureScript](http://clojurescript.org/) – [Fulcro](http://fulcro.fulcrologic.com/) (by [Fulcrologic, LLC](http://www.fulcrologic.com/)).

Fulcro 2.0 is a library for building data-driven full-stack applications for the web. It uses React, is written in Clojure and Clojurescript (so it has first-class functional abilities with immutable data) which leads to a very clean synchronous story for the UI. The result is a stack that dramatically reduces the amount of boilerplate and incidental complexity in your software.

# Full-featured

Fulcro is a full-stack library for making data-driven applications for the web. The built-in data model prevents many common errors that are made when assembling your tools from invented or selected parts.

# Less Incidental Complexity

Fulcro provides a strongly cohesive story that has many advantages over techniques, libraries, and frameworks you might have used before.

# Solve problems

Concentrate on solving your real application problems. Other systems weigh you down with asynchrony, event systems, callback hell, and REST APIs. Fulcro gives you much simpler constructs as a foundation.

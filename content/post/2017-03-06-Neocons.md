Neocons - an idiomatic, feature rich [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) client for [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/) REST API â€“ [Neocons](http://clojureneo4j.info/) (by **Michael S. Klishin**, **Alex Petrov**, and the **ClojureWerkz team**).

# From its documentation

## Neocons Overview

Neocons is an idiomatic Clojure client for the Neo4J Server REST API. It is simple and easy to use, strives to support every Neo4J Server feature, makes working with [Cypher](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/) queries a joy, takes a "batteries included" approach and is well maintained.

## What Neocons is not

Neocons is a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API client, it currently does not support working with [embedded Neo4J databases](https://neo4j.com/docs/java-reference/current/#tutorials-java-embedded). Neocons was designed for commercial products and using embedded open source Neo4J editions is not legal without obtaining a commercial license or open sourcing your entire application.

Neocons is not an ORM/ODM. It does not provide graph visualization features, although this is an interesting area to explore in the future versions. Neocons may or may not be Web Scale and puts correctness and productivity above sky high benchmarks.

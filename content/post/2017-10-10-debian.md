Where **stable** actually means **stable**! â€“ [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) (by **[Software in the Public Interest](https://www.spi-inc.org/)**).

Debian is a free operating system (OS) for your computer. An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your computer run.

Debian provides more than a pure OS: it comes with over 51000 [packages](https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages), precompiled software bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine.

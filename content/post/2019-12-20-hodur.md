Hodur is a descriptive domain modeling approach and related collection of libraries for [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) – [Hodur](https://github.com/hodur-org/hodur-engine) (by **[Tiago Luchini](https://github.com/luchiniatwork)**).

By using Hodur you can define your domain model as data, parse and validate it, and then either consume your model via an API making your apps respond to the defined model or use one of the many plugins to help you achieve mechanical, repetitive results faster and in a purely functional manner.

- hodur-datomic-schema: generates Datomic Cloud compatible schemas
- hodur-contentful-schema: generates Contentful compatible schemas

Schemas for inbound interfaces:

- hodur-lacinia-schema: generates Lacinia (GraphQL) schemas

Schemas for validation/data-generation:

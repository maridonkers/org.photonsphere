## CSS only

Bulma is a [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) framework. As such, the sole output is a single CSS file: `bulma.css`.

You can either use that file, "out of the box", or download the Sass source files to customize the variables.

There is no [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) included. People generally want to use their own JS implementation (and usually already have one). Bulma can be considered "environment agnostic": it's just the style layer on top of the logic.

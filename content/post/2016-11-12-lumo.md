The fastest Clojure REPL in the world – [Lumo](https://anmonteiro.com/2016/11/the-fastest-clojure-repl-in-the-world/) (by **António Nuno Monteiro**)
<!--more-->

# From its announcement

[Lumo](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo) is a fast, standalone ClojureScript REPL that runs on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [V8](https://developers.google.com/v8/). Thanks to V8's [custom startup snapshots](http://v8project.blogspot.com/2015/09/custom-startup-snapshots.html), Lumo starts up instantaneously, making it the fastest Clojure REPL in existence.

# Command prompt

Ideally suited to be used instead of e.g. Bash or Perl, for scripts executed from the (Linux in my case) command prompt. Plus Lumo is multi platform!

# Example (an HTTP server for IP logging)

``` clojure
#!/usr/bin/env lumo

(def http (js/require "http"))
(def process (js/require "process"))

(defn handler [req res]
  (let [dt (.toISOString (js/Date.))
        ip req.connection.remoteAddress]
    (println (str dt " - " ip))
    (.writeHead res 200 (js-obj "Content-Type" "text/html"))
    (.end res (str "<!DOCTYPE html>"
                   "<html>"
                   "<header><title>IP logger</title></header>"
                   "<body><H1>" ip " was logged at " dt "</H1></body>"
                   "</html>\n"))))

(let [host (nth (.-argv process) 3)
      port (nth (.-argv process) 4)
      server (.createServer http handler)]
  (.listen server port host)
  (println (str "IP logging server running at http://"
                host ":" port)))
```

Make the file executable and execute with host and port parameters, e.g. as follows:

``` bash
./http-ip-logger localhost 8000
```

And navigate to <http://localhost:8000>.

The **Purely Functional** Linux Distribution â€“ [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) (by [Dolstra, Eelco](http://nixos.org/~eelco/pubs/iscsd-scm11-final.pdf)).

NixOS is a Linux distribution with a unique approach to package and configuration management. Built on top of the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix), it is completely declarative, makes upgrading systems reliable, and has [many other advantages](https://nixos.org/nixos/about.html).

# Research project

NixOS started as a research project ([Dolstra, Eelco. "Integrating Software Construction and Software Deployment"](http://nixos.org/~eelco/pubs/iscsd-scm11-final.pdf)), but it is a fully functional and usable operating system.

# From its documentation:

[NixOS](https://nixos.org/nixos/about.html) is a GNU/Linux distribution that aims to improve the state of the art in system configuration management. In existing distributions, actions such as upgrades are dangerous: upgrading a package can cause other packages to break, upgrading an entire system is much less reliable than reinstalling from scratch, you can't safely test what the results of a configuration change will be, you cannot easily undo changes to the system, and so on. We want to change that. NixOS has many innovative features.

The [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator produces a site in a `public` directory but it doesn't do an incremental generate. This [Haskell](https://haskell.org) program works around that by touching all unchanged files (checksum) in the `public` directory with the modified date/time from the previous Hugo generate.

# Database
A [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database is maintained. It holds records with these fields:

 - pathName String
 - size Int64
 - md5Checksum String
 - modifiedAt UTCTime

Every time `hugoincr` is run the paths in database (from a previous run) are compared against those in the current Hugo `public` directory.

```sh
$ hugoincr -v
Connecting to database ./.hugoincr.db
Migration messages: 
CREATE TABLE "file_record"("id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,"path_name" VARCHAR NOT NULL,"size" INTEGER NOT NULL,"md5_checksum" VARCHAR NOT NULL,"modified_at" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL)
Adding 1000 records to database.
Adding 576 records to database.
```

# Incremental upload
If an incremental upload is done then the modified date/time of files is compared with files on the server, to determine whether an upload is necessary or can be skipped.

```sh
$ make upload
make[1]: Entering directory '/home/mdo/Development/Sites/org.photonsphere'
~/bin/hugoincr
(cd public ; lftp -u ftp@donkersautomatisering.nl --env-password -e "mirror -R -n -v .; bye" ftp.donkersautomatisering.nl/domains/photonsphere.org/public_html)

# Usage

(Linux, macOS and Windows builds available on GitHub)
``` sh
$ ./hugoincr --help
The hugoincr touches files (with a date/time from the previous Hugo build) in
your Hugo public directory, so only files that are actually changed get a
date/time bump when a hugo build is done. Now an ftp upload that checks files'
modified date/time will do an incremental upload.

Usage: hugoincr [--path PATH] [--target PUBLIC] [-r|--reset] [-v|--verbose] 
                [--version]

Available options:
  --path PATH              Subdirectory path where the Hugo public for the
                           increment is located.
  --target PUBLIC          Hugo public subdirectory name for the increment.
  -r,--reset               Reset database.
  -v,--verbose             Enable verbose mode.
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  --version                Show version
```

# Haskell vs. Rust
I had started coding this in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) but found myself listening to [Amy Winehouse - Back To Black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJAfLE39ZZ8) on repeat. It's hard to steer away from [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) once you've gotten acquainted with it. Like trying to listen to regular music once you've heard e.g. [Johann Sebastian Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach), [George Frideric Handel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frideric_Handel) â€” with the exception of Amy, of course.

A dark theme approach for Emacs running under KDE (Debian Linux).
<!--more-->

# Alternative approach

Configure the Invert desktop effect under KDE system settings and use Ctrl-Meta-U to activate it for the Emacs window (which uses the regular light theme). This gives a very nice dark theme like effect, which is perfect for coding when it's dark!

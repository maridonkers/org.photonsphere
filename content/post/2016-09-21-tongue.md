A do-it-yourself [i18n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization) library for [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) and [ClojureScript](http://clojurescript.org/) – [Tongue](https://github.com/tonsky/tongue) (by **Nikita Prokopov**).

# From its documentation

Tongue is very simple yet capable:

- Dictionaries are just Clojure maps.
- Translations are either strings, template strings or arbitrary functions.
- No additional build steps, no runtime resource loading.
- It comes with no built-in knowledge of world locales. It has all the tooling for you to define locales yourself though.
- Pure Clojure implementation, no dependencies.
- Can be used from both Clojure and ClojureScript.

In contrast with other i18n solutions relying on complex and limiting string-based syntax for defining pluralization, wording, special cases etc, Tongue lets you use arbitrary functions. It gives you convenience, code reuse and endless possibilities.

As a result you have a library that handles exaclty your case well with as much detail and precision as you need.

# Earlier i18n posts

My earlier i18n related posts [Lightweight i18n using DataScript](./2016-01-14-lightweight-i18n-using-datascript.html) and [Lightweight i18n using re-frame](./2016-04-22-lightweight-i18n-using-re-frame.html) are totally obsoleted by the Tongue library and should only be read for their amusement value (and perhaps some `DataScript` and `re-frame` background information).

Have simple [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) like state management facilities for building web apps with [Rum](https://github.com/tonsky/rum/) for [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) and [ClojureScript](http://clojurescript.org/) while leveraging its API – [Citrus](https://github.com/roman01la/citrus) (by **[Roman Liutikov](https://github.com/roman01la)**).

*From its documentation:*

# Features

- Decoupled application state in a single atom
- No global state, everything lives in Reconciler instance
- A notion of a controller to keep application domains separate
- Reactive queries
- Side-effects are described as data
- Async batched updates for better performance
- Server-side rendering with convenient state hydration

# How it works

With Citrus you build everything around a well known architecture pattern in modern SPA development:

- Model application state (with reconciler)
- Dispatch events (with dispatch!, dispatch-sync!, broadcast! and broadcast-sync!)
- Handle events (with :controllers functions)
- Handle side effects (with :effect-handlers functions)
- Query state reactively (with subscription, rum/react and rum/reactive)
- Render (automatic & efficient ! profit +1)

# RealWorld example appl

There is a [cljs-rum-realworld-example-app](https://github.com/roman01la/cljs-rum-realworld-example-app) on GitHub.

Cryogen is a simple static site generator built with [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) â€” [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org/) (by **Carmen La**).

# From its documentation

Cryogen is shipped on [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) so setup is fuss free and there's no need to mess with databases or other CMS systems.

Cryogen reads through a directory containing your [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) or [AsciiDoc](http://asciidoc.org/) content, compiles it into HTML and injects the content into your templates with the [Selmer](https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer) templating system. It then spits out a ready-to-publish website complete with a sitemap and RSS feed.

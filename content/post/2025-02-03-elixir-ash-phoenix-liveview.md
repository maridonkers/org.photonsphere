Looking at [team-alembic/realworld](https://github.com/team-alembic/realworld) -- A fullstack Phoenix LiveView application with backend built with Ash Framework. This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) fullstack application built with Ash + Phoenix LiveView including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

I'm ashamed to say that I think I have looked at Elixir before but must have somehow forgotten to pursue it (probably sidetracked by other matters). This is a great shame because Elixir + Ash framework + Phoenix + LiveView is very impressive and I'm pretty sure this is going to be my daily driver for development.

# Elixir
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) is a dynamic, functional language for building scalable and maintainable applications.
Elixir runs on the Erlang VM, known for creating low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems. These capabilities and Elixir tooling allow developers to be productive in several domains, such as web development, embedded software, machine learning, data pipelines, and multimedia processing, across a wide range of industries.

# Ash framework
The [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) backend [Ash framework](https://ash-hq.org/) for [unparalleled productivity](https://hexdocs.pm/ash/what-is-ash.html#why-should-i-use-it). [Declarative tools](https://hexdocs.pm/ash/design-principles.html) that let you [stop wasting time and reinventing wheels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjnPjrCF4rs). Use with [Phoenix LiveView](https://phoenixframework.org/) or [build APIs in minutes](https://hexdocs.pm/ash_graphql/getting-started-with-graphql.html) to support your front-end of choice.

# Phoenix framework
[Phoenix Framework](https://phoenixframework.org/) delivers Peace of mind from prototype to production.
Build rich, interactive web applications quickly, with less code and fewer moving parts. Join our growing community of developers using Phoenix to craft APIs, HTML5 apps and more, for fun or at scale.

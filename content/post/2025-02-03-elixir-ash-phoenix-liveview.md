Looking at [team-alembic/realworld](https://github.com/team-alembic/realworld) -- A fullstack Phoenix LiveView application with backend built with Ash Framework. This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) fullstack application built with Ash + Phoenix LiveView including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

Elixir + Ash framework + Phoenix + LiveView is quite impressive and I'm pretty sure this is going to be my daily driver for development.

# Elixir

[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)

Elixir is a dynamic, functional language for building scalable and maintainable applications.
Elixir runs on the Erlang VM, known for creating low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems. These capabilities and Elixir tooling allow developers to be productive in several domains, such as web development, embedded software, machine learning, data pipelines, and multimedia processing, across a wide range of industries.

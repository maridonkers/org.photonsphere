Realtime web comms for Clojure/Script â€“ [Sente](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente) (by **Peter Taoussanis**)
<!--more-->

# From its documentation

Sente is a small client+server library that makes it easy to build reliable, high-performance realtime web applications with Clojure + ClojureScript.

You can ignore the underlying protocol and deal directly with Sente's unified API. It's simple, and exposes the best of both WebSockets (bidirectionality + performance) and Ajax (optional evented ack/reply model).

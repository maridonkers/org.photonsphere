Conversion program from Rabobank SEPA CSV export format to KMyMoney import format.
<!--more-->

# Rabobank SEPA CSV

The [Sepa CSV-format (PDF)](https://www.rabobank.nl/images/formaatbeschrijving_csv_kommagescheiden_nieuw_29539176.pdf) that Rabobank (a Dutch bank) uses for its account export feature.

# KMyMoney

The [KMyMoney](https://kmymoney.org/) program is a personal finance manager.

# Converter

A command line converter program that takes files in Rabobank SEPA CSV format and converts them to a CSV format that can be imported by KMyMoney.

The converter program is written in [ClojureScript](http://clojurescript.org/) and can be executed by the cross-platform [Lumo](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo) REPL, which can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/releases/latest) and installed somehere in your \$PATH.

The converter program can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/maridonkers/RabobankSepa) (the `rabobank-sepa.cljs` file can be renamed to anything). If you're going to use the convert program for your personal finance then take note of the disclaimer in the downloaded source code (it's a quick hack, which I do use myself but nonetheless: caveat emptor).

# Instructions

## Initial setup

Under Linux simply make the downloaded file executable, put it somewhere in your `$PATH` and execute via (more than one filename and wildcards are allowed):

``` bash
rabobank-sepa inputfilename
```

Under Windows execute via (more than one filename is allowed):

``` bash
lumo rabobank-sepa inputfilename
```

## Converter usage

The converter program is called from the command line with one or more input files (which are in Rabobank SEPA format). It detects accounts in the input file and generates an output file per account. The output file is named `/inputfilename#account.csv/`.

``` bash
$ rabobank-sepa mut_2016-04-01_2016-06-30.csv
mut_2016-04-01_2016-06-30.csv: NL12RABO0123456789
```

The converter reports the accounts it found in the input file(s).

## KMyMoney import

\(1\) Start the import via `File->Import->CSV...`

\(2\) In the CSV Wizard select `Banking` and type a profile name (or select an existing from a previous import).

\(3\) Use the `Select File` button to select a file to import (select an output file that was generated by the converter).

\(4\) In the CSV Wizard a delimiter window is displayed, for the `Field
Delimiter` select `comma (,)` and for the `Text Delimiter` select `quote (")`. Click the `Next` button when done.

\(7\) In the CSV Wizard a decimal symbol window is displayed. The converter program has changed the decimal point in the SEPA input format to a decimal comma, so select `comma(,)` as shown below and click the =/Import CSV/= button when done.

\(8\) An account selection window is displayed. Select the account for which you are importing and click the =OK= button when done.

\(9\) A confirmation window is displayed, with a report. Confirm it and check your account to edit and accept imported transactions.

The category column that was selected in the CSV Wizard will be the category in your imported transactions but you'll have to change this to an appropriate category (one of the categories that you have configured).

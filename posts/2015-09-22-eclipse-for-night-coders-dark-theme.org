With my Eclipse running under KDE (Debian Linux) the dark themes in
Eclipse suffer from side effects. Like the disappearance of the little
menu in the title area of the window's tabs.

(.more.)

* Alternative approach
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: alternative-approach
    :END:

Configure the Invert desktop effect under KDE system settings and use
Ctrl-Meta-U to activate it for the Eclipse window (which uses the
regular light theme). This gives a very nice dark theme like effect,
which is perfect for coding when it's dark! You may want to adjust the
=Selection background= color in the Eclipse settings, which can be
found under =Window->Preferences->General->Editors->Text Editors=.

* Screendump
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: screendump

Cryogen is a simple static site generator built with [[http://clojure.org/][Clojure]] ---
[[http://cryogenweb.org/][Cryogen]] (by *Carmen La*).

(.more.)

* From its documentation

Cryogen is shipped on [[https://leiningen.org/][Leiningen]] so setup is fuss free and there's no
need to mess with databases or other CMS systems.

Cryogen reads through a directory containing your [[http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax][Markdown]] or [[http://asciidoc.org/][AsciiDoc]]
content, compiles it into HTML and injects the content into your
templates with the [[https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer][Selmer]] templating system. It then spits out a
ready-to-publish website complete with a sitemap and RSS feed.

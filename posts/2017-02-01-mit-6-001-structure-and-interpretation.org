* Overview and Introduction to Lisp
"Computer science is a terrible name. First, it's not a science. And
it's also not about computers. People in the future will recognize that
people were really formalizing intuitions about process -- how to do
things. Talking precisely about how to knowledge. As opposed to geometry
that talks about what is true."

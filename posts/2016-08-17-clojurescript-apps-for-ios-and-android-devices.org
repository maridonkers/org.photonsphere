For [[http://leiningen.org][Leiningen]]: A fork of [[https://github.com/dmotz/natal][dmotz/natal]] by Dan Motzenbecker with the goal
of generating skeleton of native app for iOS and Android based on
[[https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent][Reagent]] + [[https://github.com/Day8/re-frame][re-frame]], [[https://github.com/omcljs/om/wiki/Quick-Start-(om.next)][Om.Next]] or [[https://github.com/tonsky/rum][Rum]] -- [[https://github.com/drapanjanas/re-natal][Re-Natal]] (by *Artur Girenko*).

(.more.)

For [[https://github.com/boot-clj/boot][Boot]]: Provides several tasks that helps integrate ClojureScript
with the React Native packager and build process -- [[https://github.com/mjmeintjes/boot-react-native][Boot React Native]]

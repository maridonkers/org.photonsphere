Where *stable* actually means *stable*! -- [[https://www.debian.org/][Debian]] (by *[[https://www.spi-inc.org/][Software in the
Public Interest]]*).

Debian is a free operating system (OS) for your computer. An operating
system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your
computer run.

Debian provides more than a pure OS: it comes with over 51000

installation on your machine.

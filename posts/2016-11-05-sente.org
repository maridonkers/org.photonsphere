Realtime web comms for Clojure/Script -- [[https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente][Sente]] (by *Peter Taoussanis*)

(.more.)

* From its documentation

Sente is a small client+server library that makes it easy to build
reliable, high-performance realtime web applications with Clojure +
ClojureScript.

You can ignore the underlying protocol and deal directly with Sente's
unified API. It's simple, and exposes the best of both WebSockets
(bidirectionality + performance) and Ajax (optional evented ack/reply
model).

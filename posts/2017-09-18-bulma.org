Modern CSS framework based on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Flex_Box_Layout][Flexbox]] -- [[https://github.com/jgthms/bulma][Bulma]] (by *[[https://github.com/jgthms][Jeremy Thomas]]*).

Bulma is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets][CSS]] framework. As such, the sole output is a single CSS
file: =bulma.css=.

You can either use that file, "out of the box", or download the Sass
source files to customize the variables.

There is no [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript][JavaScript]] included. People generally want to use their
own JS implementation (and usually already have one). Bulma can be
considered "environment agnostic": it's just the style layer on top of
the logic.

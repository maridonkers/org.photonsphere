----

A [[https://haskell.org][Haskell]] program to convert the [[https://www.paperspan.com][Paperspan]] HTML export format to an [[https://instapaper.com][Instapaper]] CVS import format. 

(.more.)

Paperspan HTML export to Instapaper CSV import. With folders.yaml
configuration file, which contains Instapaper target folder names (for
output file) and regular expressions for url or text in Paperspan
export (which is input).
    
Usage: see the Makefile.

* GitHub

  The source code for the convertor program is on GitHub: [[https://github.com/maridonkers/paperspan2instapaper][maridonkers/paperspan2instapaper]].

Disclaimer: this is a 'one shot' (excuse my Haskell) program that I've used only once to import an export of my 27689 Paperspan article links into Instapaper.

* Earlier
  Earlier this [[https://photonsphere.org/posts/2019-02-18-instapaper-export.html][2019-02-18-instapaper-export]] was used for an Instpaper HTML export to Paperspan import.

  (Hopping back and forth between these excellent read-later/archiving solutions.)

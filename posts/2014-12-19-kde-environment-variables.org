The KDE desktop environment supports environment variables. These are
active when logged in to KDE. Contrary to regular bash environment
variables, which are active only when a bash shell is started.

(.more.)

To set KDE environment variables create a file in the =.kde4/env=
or =.kde/env= directory, e.g. as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
export MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME="/opt/firefox"
#+END_SRC

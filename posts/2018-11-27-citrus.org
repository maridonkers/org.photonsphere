Have simple [[https://github.com/Day8/re-frame][re-frame]] like state management facilities for building web
apps with [[https://github.com/tonsky/rum/][Rum]] for [[http://clojure.org/][Clojure]] and [[http://clojurescript.org/][ClojureScript]] while leveraging its API
-- [[https://github.com/roman01la/citrus][Citrus]] (by *[[https://github.com/roman01la][Roman Liutikov]]*).

/From its documentation:/

* Features
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: features
   :END:

- Decoupled application state in a single atom
- No global state, everything lives in Reconciler instance
- A notion of a controller to keep application domains separate
- Reactive queries
- Side-effects are described as data
- Async batched updates for better performance
- Server-side rendering with convenient state hydration

* How it works
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: how-it-works
   :END:

With Citrus you build everything around a well known architecture
pattern in modern SPA development:

- Model application state (with reconciler)
- Dispatch events (with dispatch!, dispatch-sync!, broadcast! and broadcast-sync!)
- Handle events (with :controllers functions)
- Handle side effects (with :effect-handlers functions)
- Query state reactively (with subscription, rum/react and rum/reactive)
- Render (automatic & efficient ! profit +1)

* RealWorld example appl

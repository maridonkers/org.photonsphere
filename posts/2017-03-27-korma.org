Korma is a domain specific language for Clojure that takes the pain
out of working with your favorite [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system][RDBMS]]. Built for speed and designed
for flexibility, Korma provides a simple and intuitive interface to
your data that won't leave a bad taste in your mouth.

The fastest Clojure REPL in the world -- [[https://anmonteiro.com/2016/11/the-fastest-clojure-repl-in-the-world/][Lumo]] (by *Ant√≥nio Nuno
Monteiro*)

(.more.)

* From its announcement

[[https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo][Lumo]] is a fast, standalone ClojureScript REPL that runs on [[http://nodejs.org/][Node.js]]
and [[https://developers.google.com/v8/][V8]]. Thanks to V8's [[http://v8project.blogspot.com/2015/09/custom-startup-snapshots.html][custom startup snapshots]], Lumo starts up
instantaneously, making it the fastest Clojure REPL in existence.

* Command prompt

Ideally suited to be used instead of e.g. Bash or Perl, for scripts
executed from the (Linux in my case) command prompt. Plus Lumo is
multi platform!

* Example (an HTTP server for IP logging)

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
#!/usr/bin/env lumo

(def http (js/require "http"))
(def process (js/require "process"))
 
(defn handler [req res]
  (let [dt (.toISOString (js/Date.))
        ip req.connection.remoteAddress]
    (println (str dt " - " ip))
    (.writeHead res 200 (js-obj "Content-Type" "text/html"))
    (.end res (str "<!DOCTYPE html>"
                   "<html>"
                   "<header><title>IP logger</title></header>"
                   "<body><H1>" ip " was logged at " dt "</H1></body>"
                   "</html>\n"))))
 
(let [host (nth (.-argv process) 3)
      port (nth (.-argv process) 4)
      server (.createServer http handler)]
  (.listen server port host)
  (println (str "IP logging server running at http://"
                host ":" port)))
#+END_SRC

Make the file executable and execute with host and port parameters, e.g. as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./http-ip-logger localhost 8000
#+END_SRC

And navigate to http://localhost:8000.

Under Linux, you can use the [[http://www.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php/Isohybrid][isohybrid]] command to attempt to fix an
ISO intended for a USB-stick, but that does not boot (because e.g. it
expects a real DVD).

(.more.)

Warning and disclaimer: do make sure that you make a copy of your
image file first and execute the isohybrid command on the copy.

The command to use is as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
isohybrid copy-of-your-image.iso
#+END_SRC

(Note: this requires syslinux to be installed.)

JavaFX in the Browser - NO PLUGINS - EVERYWHERE -- [[https://www.jpro.io/][JPRO]] (by *jpro
technologies AG*).

(.more.)

* From its documentation

jpro is a new technology which brings Java back into the browser -
without Java Plugin. To achieve that, jpro runs [[https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/][JavaFX]] on the server
and maps its scenegraph directly into the browser. The client side
rendering is highly optimized with browser side approximations to get
a smooth user experience free of lags.

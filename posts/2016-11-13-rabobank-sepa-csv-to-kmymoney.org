(.more.)

* Rabobank SEPA CSV
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: rabobank-sepa-csv
     :END:

The [[https://www.rabobank.nl/images/formaatbeschrijving_csv_kommagescheiden_nieuw_29539176.pdf][Sepa CSV-format (PDF)]] that Rabobank (a Dutch bank) uses for its account export feature.

* KMyMoney
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: kmymoney
     :END:

The [[https://kmymoney.org/][KMyMoney]] program is a personal finance manager.

* Converter
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: converter
     :END:

A command line converter program that takes files in Rabobank SEPA CSV
format and converts them to a CSV format that can be imported by
KMyMoney.

The converter program is written in [[http://clojurescript.org/][ClojureScript]] and can be executed
by the cross-platform [[https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo][Lumo]] REPL, which can be downloaded from [[https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo/releases/latest][here]] and
installed somehere in your $PATH.

The converter program can be downloaded from [[https://github.com/maridonkers/RabobankSepa][GitHub]] (the
=rabobank-sepa.cljs= file can be renamed to anything). If you're
going to use the convert program for your personal finance then take
note of the disclaimer in the downloaded source code (it's a quick
hack, which I do use myself but nonetheless: caveat emptor).

* Instructions

** Initial setup

Under Linux simply make the downloaded file executable, put it
somewhere in your =$PATH= and execute via (more than one filename and
wildcards are allowed):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rabobank-sepa inputfilename
#+END_SRC

Under Windows execute via (more than one filename is allowed):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
lumo rabobank-sepa inputfilename
#+END_SRC

** Converter usage

The converter program is called from the command line with one or more
input files (which are in Rabobank SEPA format). It detects accounts
in the input file and generates an output file per account. The output
file is named =/inputfilename#account.csv/=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ rabobank-sepa mut_2016-04-01_2016-06-30.csv
mut_2016-04-01_2016-06-30.csv: NL12RABO0123456789
#+END_SRC

The converter reports the accounts it found in the input file(s).

** KMyMoney import

(1) Start the import via =File->Import->CSV...=

(2) In the CSV Wizard select =Banking= and type a profile name (or
select an existing from a previous import).

(3) Use the =Select File= button to select a file to import (select an
output file that was generated by the converter).

(4) In the CSV Wizard a delimiter window is displayed, for the =Field
Delimiter= select =comma (,)= and for the =Text Delimiter= select
=quote (")=. Click the =Next= button when done.

(7) In the CSV Wizard a decimal symbol window is displayed. The
converter program has changed the decimal point in the SEPA input format
to a decimal comma, so select =comma(,)= as shown below and click
the =/Import CSV/= button when done.

(8) An account selection window is displayed. Select the account for
which you are importing and click the =OK= button when done.

(9) A confirmation window is displayed, with a report. Confirm it and
check your account to edit and accept imported transactions.

The category column that was selected in the CSV Wizard will be the
category in your imported transactions but you'll have to change this
to an appropriate category (one of the categories that you have
configured).

# Brave browser

tut â€” Jun '22
I have observed some strange issue with `Hugo` whether on (blank) new sites or existing sites. I use `Brave` browser and if no permalinks are defined in the config file, the single pages enter into the Quirks Mode and the layout/stylesheets are broken. Everything else works properly on Firefox (I have only tested both browsers). I am not sure why the layout breaks.

If anyone comes across this issue, the `speed reader` option in Brave is to blame. Turn it off in settings!

To clone including submodules (e.g. themes), use `--recurse-submodules`.
